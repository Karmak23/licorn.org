Title: New section: “ Specifications ”

This is muuuuch comfortable and fast to write a Markdown file than to edit a wiki. I've started to write Licorn® [specifications][] here on the current website. This allow the public to follow the current developments.

For the moment you will only find one draft, but it's kind of the central one.

All the previous specifications on dev1.licorn.org – which is down, anyway – are kind of outdated. I also consider them irrelevant in the current development phase: I started from scratch and need the board to be completely clear. I will eventually pull some of them back here during the process.
