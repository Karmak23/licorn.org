Title: Switching to Trello
Tags: status, management, software
Lang: en

I want to code, and I want to do it fast and now. I just want Licorn® to exist and roll on.

I also want to maintain a totally public management for the project.

I will thus use *[Github][github] only* for the code, and [Trello][trello] for the **roadmap / features / tickets / support** management. Still don't know how to mix github issues with Trello one, but we will find it along the way.

Trello is damn-simple to use, while offering roughly the same functionnalities we already had in Trac. Usability is just kind of “ streamlined ” and everything is just easier to do. Less friction.

Maintaining dev.licorn.org, in my current conditions, is another waste of time. I decided to give away a – very relative and small – part of my freedom, to gain a handfull of time to do other things. And code.

So here we go in case you didn't click on previous links: [Licorn® on Github][github], [Licorn® on Trello][trello].
