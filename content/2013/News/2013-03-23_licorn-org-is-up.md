Title: Licorn® main site is finally up!

After many years of (perfectly motivated) procrastination, [licorn.org](http://licorn.org/) is up to please you with some basic content.

The main argument for not existing was the fact that we already had [docs.licorn.org](http://docs.licorn.org/) since 2009 which does a good job at presenting the software functionnality, and [dev.licorn.org](http://dev.licorn.org) since the project start which announces the new releases. An institutional website was then thought to duplicate content and an overkill to maintain with available tools, given the human resources I had (myself only!).

Granted, the current website should probably just have redirected to [dev](http://dev.licorn.org/) since the time, instead of pointing to the void or displaying a forever *under construction* page.

Anyway, maintaining this [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/) website is much easier, simple and comfortable than writing blog posts in Trac – which doesn't affect Trac's quality at tracking software development. I'm not mentionning the clever text-only file storage and versionning vs. complex database storage.

As of now, Licorn® release announcements will be made [here on licorn.org](http://licorn.org/news), and twitted each time I remember [Licorn® has its own account](https://twitter.com/Licorn_info) ;-)

I hope you will enjoy this website, and find it useful as much as I have fun writing it.
